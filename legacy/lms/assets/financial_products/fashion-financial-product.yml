  # Interest configs
  # Currently only supported INTEREST mechanism is FIXED, DECLINING and MONTHLY compounding
  interest:
    # This means that the interest rate does not change over time.
    type: FIXED

    # This means that the interest rate calculation is done on the declining outstanding balance.
    methodology: DECLINING

    # This means that the interest rate calculation is done based on a monthly compounding frequency.
    compounding_frequency: MONTHLY
    # This means that monthly interest needs to be rounded up to nearest pounds

# for the tenor 12 months, all 12 months the interest = 30%

# Late fee accounting process not yet implemented.
