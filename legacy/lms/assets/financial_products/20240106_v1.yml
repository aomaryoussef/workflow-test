configuration:
  # Interest configs are right now hard-coded
  # Adding this as configuration is rather very low effort
  interest:
    # This means that the interest rate does not change over time.
    type: FIXED
    # This means that the interest rate calculation is done on the declining outstanding balance.
    methodology: DECLINING
    # This means that the interest rate calculation is done based on a monthly compounding frequency.
    compounding_frequency: MONTHLY
    # This means that monthly interest needs to be rounded up to nearest pounds

    # 2 types are supported: MONETARY | FORMULA
    # In case of MONETARY, the value means the fixed money itself e.g. EGP 30.08
    # In case of FORMULA, the value has a fix and a percentage part, separated by the + sign. e.g. 5.00%+30.08 means (5% of principal + EGP30.08)

    # then the rest of them will be omitted. No rounding off will be used
